## Console-Finances

## Description
This is the solution for the challenge from EdX bootcamp, Week 4, Day 4. 
During Week 4 at the bootcamp, I learnt basic Javascript and my task was to apply the skills I got and write a JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period. You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
4. The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
